2000s hip-hop/R&B club banger with soulful female lead and charismatic male hype man. Smooth Rhodes chords, thick sub-bass, crunchy boom-bap drums, handclap backbeat, and gliding string pads at ~96 BPM. Lyrics are witty dev parody bragging about Milkshake UI, mixing playful bravado with satirical jabs at old workflow pain. Include chantable hook where the crowd spells out "Milkshake U-I" plus background la-la riffs. Bridge drops to spoken-word swagger with light vocoder ad-libs. Keep it confident, inclusive, polished - think 2003 Neptunes meets Missy/Timbaland energy.
